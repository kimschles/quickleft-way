# How Quick Left Manages the Engineering Team

Quick Left is in the business of finding, retaining and developing the best software developers in the business. The nature of our work demands that we be on top of new technologies before our clients, to be in the best position to help them take advantage of opportunities.

The structure of the Quick Left engineering team and its management serves these goals.

## VP of Engineering

The VP of Engineering is responsible for all hiring and reviews of software developers, setting the direction of the Quick Left engineering team and working with the rest of the business (including the VP of Delivery) to deliver high quality products to our clients. The Engineering Leads and Software Developers report to the VP of Engineering.

## Engineering Leads

The Engineering Leads meet with the VP of Engineering on a weekly basis to help guide the direction of the engineering team. The Leads are responsible for ongoing mentorship of their fellow software developers.

## Career Development and Team Management

The direction of the engineering team and the career development of individual developers is driven day to day by the team and its management. Several checkpoints are scheduled regularly to ensure the team and individuals continue to grow and adapt to changing conditions.

* One on Ones - Quick Left developers meet one on one with the VP of Engineering at least once a quarter. Developers can ask for a one on one at anytime in addition to the regularly quarterly meeting. These one on ones are meant to help the developer plan their career at Quick Left and achieve their short and long term goals.
* Weekly Engineering All Hands - The full team meets once a week to discuss team direction and issues.
* Daily In Person Stand Up - Each office holds a daily stand up meeting (Monday and Wednesday are exceptions, we have company all hands on Monday and Engineering all hands on Wednesday) to discuss current projects and any learning the developers would like to share with the team.
* Weekly Engineering Leads Meeting - A weekly meeting between the VP of Engineering and the Engineering Leads to discuss team health and direction.


## Future

* Director of Engineering - planned hire to help supplement the VP of Engineering and manage software developers.
* Sales Support Engineer - members of the engineering team with an interest in sales are being trained to help support the sales cycle from a technical perspective. A portion of their time will be spent working with the sales team on new project proposals.
