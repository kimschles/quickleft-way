# Quick Left Project Lead Responsibilities

## Intro

This document is meant to clarify the responsibilities of the Project Lead role. We want to ensure that we have a consistent process to provide the best possible experience for our clients. What follows is a list of the responsibilities that Project Leads should be taking on in their day-to-day work. As we have a wide variety of project types, there may be times when some of these items don’t apply. Project Leads have the prerogative to omit items if there is a good reason.

## Responsibilities

### Agile

- Estimating Scope
Lead the estimation process, break large tickets down into smaller tickets, run “estimation poker”.

- Backlog Grooming
Ensure that tickets are estimated. Ensure that upcoming tickets have proper documentation / comps, and get answers to questions on them before they are pulled into the sprint.

- Story Point Monitoring
Be able to answer the question “how much more work do we have in the project” in story points. Be able to answer the question “what is the team’s velocity” in story points per sprint/week.

- Scope Change Monitoring
Combine budget monitoring (see below) and story point monitoring information to raise the flag if we can’t hit our goals given the remaining budget. Participate in the resulting discussion of what that means moving forward.

- Organizing Daily Standup
Create a calendar invite, make sure everyone is attending, kick off standup meetings.

### Client Relationship

- Budget Monitoring
Be able to answer the question “how much more time do we have in the budget” in days or hours, up through yesterday.

- Flagging Roadblocks With Clients
Communicate any roadblocks to the client. E.g. “we're not getting design approvals in time”, or “we're not getting any feedback from the client”.
*Notify your account manager*

- Communicating Effectively With Clients
In collaboration with your account manager, deliver difficult news to clients with tact and make sure you’re getting the results you need from them.

- Producing Documentation
Ensure that setup, code, and handover documentation is being generated as the project progresses so that we don’t have to scramble to produce it at the end.

### QL Team Support

- Dev Support
Help your team with clearing roadblocks, working through architecture decisions, choosing the right tools, fixing bugs, and any other needs that arise in the context of the project.

- Day-to-day Focus
Ensure that your team knows what the top priorities are on a daily basis.

- Filling Out Timesheets Daily
Make sure that all team members are filling out timesheets on a daily basis.

- Filling Out Heartbeat Weekly
Fill out your Heartbeat update prior to the Project Leads standup at 1:30 (MST) on Monday afternoon.
