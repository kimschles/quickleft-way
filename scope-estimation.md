# Scope Estimation Worksheet

Use this worksheet to help estimate a proposed project. When business development asks engineering to estimate a proposed project, this is where we start. Your estimate for the project isn't binding, we're always a time and materials service company, but estimates are part of what we do. 

1. What languages/frameworks are involved? (eg., Rails, Python, JavaScript, Backbone)

2. Does the project overview provide a time or budget constraint?

3. Are there any red flags? Does anything seem particularly risky? These are useful to highlight to sales, too.

4. Is there any hidden work? Something that the project might need, but isn’t called out in the proposal?

5. What "nouns" are involved? Think in terms of database models, big components, etc.
examples: User, GitHub integration, an external API. Think roughly in terms of what might take a week to implement.

6. How many nouns did you come up with? Take the hidden work into consideration here.

7. Now lets do some math. We’ll add 30% to our number of nouns as a way to account for unknowns:
     # nouns * 1.3 = # weeks per pair of devs

_______ * 1.3 = _________

8. Does that number “feel” right? If not, adjust it.

9. Does this project need design work? If so, how much?

10. Does this project need an inception and/or discovery? If so, estimate how much it would cost.

11. Add up the estimate. Dev pair weeks + solo design weeks + inception/discovery. Multiply each week * our rate and get a total estimate.

12. Sometimes our estimate might be more than what a potential client can afford. If we need to suggest a scope reduction, which few features would you recommend we cut?

13. Find another engineer to review all of the above, do they agree?
